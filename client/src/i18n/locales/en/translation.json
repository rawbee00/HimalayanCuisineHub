    "paragraph1": "Our story is a journeyâ€”one that begins high in the Himalayas, near the foot of Sagarmatha (Mount Everest), and winds its way to the tranquil shores of Costa del Silencio.",
    "paragraph2": "Raised among the rich traditions of Nepali cuisine, we learned that food is more than ingredientsâ€”it's a connection to land, family, and heritage. From open-fire sekuwa to the comforting warmth of goat curry, every meal was a celebration of life's simplest joys.",
    "paragraph3": "With time, our path led us across continents. Carrying our flavors, our stories, and our dreams, we arrived in Tenerife with one goal: to share the essence of Nepal with a new home.",
    "paragraph4": "Himalayan Curry & Tandoori House is the result of that journeyâ€”a humble space where bold Himalayan spices meet the breeze of the Atlantic. Every dish is prepared with care, tradition, and the hope that you'll taste not just the food, but the journey behind it.",
